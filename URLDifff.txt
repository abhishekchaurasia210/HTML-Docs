Absolute url:
---------------

  protocol://domain/path


An absolute URL contains more information than a relative URL does. Relative URLs are moreconvenient because they are shorter and often more portable. 
However, you can use them only to reference links on the same
 server as the page that contains them.


Relative url:
--------------

  <a href="foobar.html">The Wonderful World of Foobar!</a>

Relative URLs can take a number of different forms. When referring to a file that occurs in
 the same directory as the referring page, a URL can be as simple as the name of the file. For example,
 if you want to create a link in your home page to the file foobar.html, which is in the same directory 
as your home page.



Subdirectory:
-----------------
If the file you want to link to is in a subdirectory of the referring page's directory,
 you need to enter only the directory information and the name of the file. So if foobar.html 
were in the foobar subdirectory of your www directory, you could refer to it from your home page by using:

  <a href="foobar/foobar.html">The Wonderful World of Foobar!</a>


If the file you want to link to is in a higher directory than the referring page, 
use .., which means to go up a directory. For example, to link from foobar.html to home.html,
 which is in the directory above, you would use:

  <a href="../home.html">Go back to my home page</a>
